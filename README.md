# JavaScript Custom Time Selection Chart

![JavaScript Custom Time Selection Chart](customTimeSelectionInteraction-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example showcases the creation of a custom user interaction.

Any custom interaction can be implemented with different event subscription methods.
In this example, `ChartXY.addEventListener` is used to hook on to the event when user drags with mouse inside the series area.
An Axis band is used to highlight the selected time range, and after user stops dragging the Line series is colored so that selected points are focused whereas other points are "unfocused".

This idea of custom interactions can be extended to any application specific dynamic interaction, like deleting selected points, displaying them in a separate chart or moving them - imagination is the limit!
